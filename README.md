# Cosmolalia Project
Welcome to Cosmolalia, a speculative framework exploring the universe as a communicative whole, where *1=0* unifies paradox and meaning. This repository hosts our foundational artifacts:

- [Cosmolalia Manifesto](/docs/Cosmolalia Manifesto.markdown): Defines the theoretical boundaries and core axioms.
- [Ethical Charter](/docs/Ethical Charter for Cosmolalia.markdown): Guides responsible development and dissemination.

Join us in articulating the language of reality! Share feedback via GitHub Issues or join the conversation on X (#Cosmolalia, #1equals0).
